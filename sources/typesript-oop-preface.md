# preface of typescript oop version

> after my first functional iteration are done, I got this answer:

Thank you for completing the test exercise. I have really enjoyed the visuals, and I also have to admit we usually do not receive FP games very often. While it is very clear that a lot of effort has gone into the test task, I have found the functional approach quite unusual for a game and it took a bit to understand the similarities between RxJS and the callbag library. Games are inherently very stateful, so I assume you chose this approach as a challenge? 

We do use functional patterns extensively in our UI (built on preact), our  bread and butter is still OOP and typescript for the games, and will continue to be in the foreseeable future. I believe that using functional patterns in JS requires a deeper understanding of it, and a dedication to follow the evolution of the language itself. Still, for the reason above it is very important to me to get a clear picture of every candidate's OOP skills.

If you are interested, I would like to ask you to recreate the game using typescript and OOP patterns so I could get a clearer picture.Thank you for completing the test exercise.

## let's work
Maybe I will like the typescript language as type documentation part of code. First stepp is do a couple typescript test.
